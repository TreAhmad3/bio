My name is Tre’ Anderson-Davis and I was born in Concord, North Carolina. Being passionate for music, I listen to almost any song I can be my hands on and always have shazam ready to go to teach me about a new song. In elementary school, class came easy to me and I was accepted into the AIG program in 4th grade. Being interested in iOS development in high school, I quickly figured out that it would be too challenging for me and I began studying web development after graduation. I took my freshman year of college at East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina. I would’ve been a college sophomore but as a freshman I decided that a career path in web development would be the best for me.  Now the Coding Boot Camp at UNC Charlotte has become my coding home. Prior to enrolling in the boot camp I was creating small websites for my friends using fundamental knowledge of HTML and CSS. My hobbies may be a long list so I’ll just say that my two main hobbies are enjoying music and coding. As a child comedy was interesting to me but I never got around to writing any jokes but I enjoy watching stand-up comedy when I get a chance. I’m an all around creative who loves to make anything from music, to color pallets, to writing sketches, to coding websites.
